# Chingu Meeting App

## Overview
Friends can put in when they are available for a meetup/party (Basically like when2meet). They can also have a shared grocery list that is for BBQ/Birtday party.
Furthermore, everyone can enter who buys/brings what, so you don't end up with too much or too little stuff.
